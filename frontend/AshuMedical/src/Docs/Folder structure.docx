That sounds like a solid tech stack! Here are some design ideas for your pharmacy platform:

### **1. Core Features**
- **User Authentication:** Secure login/signup with JWT-based authentication.
- **Product Catalog:** Display medicines with categories, search, and filters.
- **Prescription Upload:** Allow users to upload prescriptions for verification.
- **Cart & Checkout:** Add to cart, apply discounts, and choose payment options.
- **Order Tracking:** Real-time order status updates.
- **Pharmacy Dashboard:** Admin panel for managing inventory, orders, and users.
- **Notifications:** Email/SMS alerts for order updates and medicine refills.
- **AI Chatbot (Optional):** Assist users with medicine queries.

### **2. Tech Stack Overview**
- **Backend (Deno + Oak Framework)**
  - API routes for product listing, orders, authentication.
  - Database: PostgreSQL (via Denoâ€™s Drash or Prisma for ORM).
  - Middleware for request validation and logging.
  
- **Frontend (React + Tailwind)**
  - Component-based UI for easy scalability.
  - Redux/Zustand for state management.
  - React Query for API fetching.
  - Next.js (optional) for SSR performance boost.

### **3. UI/UX Considerations**
- **Minimalist UI:** Clean, medical-themed color scheme (white, green, blue).
- **Accessibility:** Large buttons, high-contrast text.
- **Mobile Optimization:** Responsive design with a PWA for easy mobile use.
- **Dark Mode (Optional):** For better accessibility.

### **4. Security Measures**
- **Secure API calls:** HTTPS, CORS policies, rate limiting.
- **User Data Protection:** Encrypt sensitive data.
- **Role-based Access:** Different permissions for users, pharmacists, and admins.
